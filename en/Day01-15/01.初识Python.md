## New to Python

### Introduction to Python

#### The history of Python

1. Christmas in 1989: Guido von Rossum began writing a compiler for Python.
2. February 1991: The first Python compiler (also an interpreter) was born. It was implemented in C (behind) and could call C language library functions. In the earliest version, Python has provided support for building blocks such as "classes", "functions", and "exception handling", as well as core data types such as lists and dictionaries. It also supports building applications based on modules .
3. January 1994: Python 1.0 was officially released.
4. October 16, 2000: Python 2.0 was released, adding full [garbage collection](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9E%83%E5%9C%BE%E5%9B%9E%E6%94%B6_(%E8%A8%88%E7%AE%97%E6%A9%9F%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%B8)) and providing support for [Unicode](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) . At the same time, the entire development process of Python is more transparent, the community's influence on the development progress is gradually expanding, and the ecosystem is slowly forming.
5. December 3, 2008: Python 3.0 was released. It is not fully compatible with the previous Python code, but because there are still many companies using Python 2.x versions in projects and operations, Python 3.x has many new The feature was later ported to Python 2.6/2.7.

The version of Python 3.7.x that we currently use was released in 2018. The version number of Python is divided into three sections, shaped like ABC. Where A is the major version number, generally when the overall rewrite, or there is a change that is not backward compatible, increase A; B means the function is updated, the new function is added B; C means a small change (for example: repair a certain Bug), add C whenever there is a modification. If you are interested in the history of Python, you can read a web article called ["A Brief History of Python"](http://www.cnblogs.com/vamei/archive/2013/02/06/2892628.html) .

#### Advantages and disadvantages of Python

The advantages of Python are many, simple can be summarized as the following points.

1. Simple and clear, with a low learning curve, it is easier to get started than many programming languages.
2. Open source, with a strong community and ecosystem, especially in the field of data analysis and machine learning.
3. The interpreted language is inherently platform-portable, and the code can work on different operating systems.
4. Support for two mainstream programming paradigms (object-oriented programming and functional programming).
5. The code is highly standardized and readable, and is suitable for people with code cleanliness and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

The shortcomings of Python are mainly concentrated in the following points.

1. The execution efficiency is slightly lower, and the parts that require high execution efficiency can be written by other languages (such as C, C++).
2. The code cannot be encrypted, but now many companies do not sell software but sell services, this problem will be weakened.
3. There are too many frameworks that can be selected during development (for example, there are more than 100 web frameworks), and there are errors in the choices.

#### Applications of Python

At present, Python has a wide range of applications in the fields of web application back-end development, cloud infrastructure construction, DevOps, network data collection (crawler), automated testing, data analysis, and machine learning.

### Install the Python interpreter

To start a Python programming journey, you must first install the Python interpreter environment on the computer you use. The following will take the installation of the official Python interpreter as an example to explain how to install the Python environment on different operating systems. The official Python interpreter is implemented in C and is also the most widely used Python interpreter, often called CPython. In addition, the Python interpreter has Jython implemented in Java, IronPython implemented in C#, and versions such as PyPy, Brython, and Pyston. Interested readers can learn about it by themselves.

#### Windows environment

You can download Python's Windows installer (exe file) on the [Python official website](https://www.python.org) . It is important to note that if you install Python 3.x in the Windows 7 environment, you need to install the Service Pack 1 patch package (you can automatically install the system through some tool software The function of the patch is installed), the installation process is recommended to check "Add Python 3.x to PATH" (add Python 3.x to the PATH environment variable) and select a custom installation, it is best to set "Optional Features" interface " "pip", "tcl/tk", "Python test suite" and other items are all checked. It is strongly recommended to choose a custom installation path and ensure that there is no Chinese in the path. After the installation is complete, you will see a "Setup was successful" prompt. If you run the Python program later and there is a problem that the Python interpreter cannot work because some dynamic link library files are missing, you can solve it according to the following methods.

If the system shows that the api-ms-win-crt*.dll file is missing, you can refer to the ["api-ms-win-crt*.dll missing cause analysis and solution"](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/32087135) article to deal with the method explained or download Visual C++ directly on the [Microsoft official website](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/download/details.aspx?id=48145) Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 files to be repaired; if it is due to the problem of missing some dynamic link library files after updating DirectX for Windows, you can download a [DirectX repair tool](https://dl.pconline.com.cn/download/360074-1.html) to repair.

#### Linux environment

The Linux environment comes with the Python 2.x version, but if you want to update to the 3.x version, you can download the Python source code on the [Python official website](https://www.python.org) and install it by source code construction and installation. The specific steps are as follows (Take CentOS as an example).

1. Install dependent libraries (because without these dependent libraries, it may fail due to missing underlying dependent libraries during source code component installation).

```Shell
yum -y install wget gcc zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel readline-devel tk-devel gdbm-devel db4-devel libpcap-devel xz-devel libffi-devel
```

1. Download the Python source code and unzip it to the specified directory.

```Shell
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.6/Python-3.7.6.tar.xz
xz -d Python-3.7.6.tar.xz
tar -xvf Python-3.7.6.tar
```

1. Switch to the Python source code directory and execute the following commands to configure and install.

```Shell
cd Python-3.7.6
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/python37 --enable-optimizations
make && make install
```

1. Modify the file named .bash_profile in the user's home directory, configure the PATH environment variable and make it effective.

```Shell
cd ~
vim .bash_profile
```

```Shell
# ... 此处省略上面的代码 ...

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/python37/bin

# ... 此处省略下面的代码 ...
```

1. Activate environment variables.

```Shell
source .bash_profile
```

#### macOS environment

macOS also comes with Python 2.x version, you can install Python 3.x version through the installation file (pkg file) provided by [Python's official website](https://www.python.org) . After the default installation is complete, you can execute the `python` command in the terminal to start the 2.x version of the Python interpreter. Starting the 3.x version of the Python interpreter requires executing the `python3` command.

### Run Python program

#### Confirm Python version

You can type the following command in the Windows command line prompt.

```Shell
python --version
```

Type the following command in the terminal of Linux or macOS system.

```Shell
python3 --version
```

Of course, you can also enter `python` or `python3` enter the interactive environment, and then execute the following code to check the Python version.

```Python
import sys

print(sys.version_info)
print(sys.version)
```

#### Write Python source code

You can use text editing tools (recommended to use advanced text editing tools such as [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ) to write Python source code and save the file with py as the suffix. The code content is shown below.

```Python
print('hello, world!')
```

#### Run the program

Switch to the directory where the source code is located and execute the following command to see if "hello, world!" is output on the screen.

```Shell
python hello.py
```

or

```Shell
python3 hello.py
```

#### Comments in the code

Comments are an important part of the programming language. They are used to explain the role of the code in the source code to enhance the readability and maintainability of the program. Of course, you can also remove the code segments in the source code that do not need to participate in the operation through comments. This is often used when debugging programs. The comment will be removed when entering the preprocessor or compiling with the source code, and will not be retained in the target code nor will it affect the execution result of the program.

1. Single-line comments-sections beginning with # and spaces
2. Multi-line comments-three quotation marks at the beginning and three quotation marks at the end

```Python
"""
第一个Python程序 - hello, world!
向伟大的Dennis M. Ritchie先生致敬

Version: 0.1
Author: 骆昊
"""
print('hello, world!')
# print("你好, 世界！")
```

### Python development tools

#### IDLE-comes with integrated development tools

IDLE is an integrated development tool that comes with the Python environment installed, as shown in the following figure. However, because IDLE's user experience is not so good, it is rarely used in actual development.

#### IPython-better interactive programming tool

IPython is an interactive interpreter based on Python. Compared with the native Python interactive environment, IPython provides more powerful editing and interactive functions. You can install IPython through Python's package management tool pip. The specific operations are as follows.

```Shell
pip install ipython
```

or

```Shell
pip3 install ipython
```

After the installation is successful, you can start IPython through the following ipython command, as shown below.

#### Sublime Text-Advanced text editor

![](./res/python-sublime.png)

- First, you can install Sublime Text 3 or Sublime Text 2 through the [official website](https://www.sublimetext.com/) download installer.

- Install package management tools.

    1. Open the console through the shortcut key Ctrl+` or select Show Console in the View menu, enter the following code.

    - Sublime 3

    ```Python
    import  urllib.request,os;pf='Package Control.sublime-package';ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path();urllib.request.install_opener(urllib.request.build_opener(urllib.request.ProxyHandler()));open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),'wb').write(urllib.request.urlopen('http://sublime.wbond.net/'+pf.replace(' ','%20')).read())
    ```

    - Sublime 2

    ```Python
    import  urllib2,os;pf='Package Control.sublime-package';ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path();os.makedirs(ipp)ifnotos.path.exists(ipp)elseNone;urllib2.install_opener(urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.ProxyHandler()));open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),'wb').write(urllib2.urlopen('http://sublime.wbond.net/'+pf.replace(' ','%20')).read());print('Please restart Sublime Text to finish installation')
    ```

    1. Enter https://sublime.wbond.net/Package%20Control.sublime-package in the browser to download the installation package of the package management tool, and find the directory named "Installed Packages" under the Sublime installation directory, and put the file you just downloaded. Put it in this file, and then restart Sublime Text.

- Install the plugin. Open the command panel through Package Control or shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+P of the Preference menu, enter Install Package in the panel to find the tool to install the plug-in, and then find the required plug-in. We recommend that you install the following plug-ins:

    - SublimeCodeIntel-plugin for automatic code completion tool.
    - Emmet-Front-end development code template plugin.
    - Git-Version control tool plugin.
    - Python PEP8 Autoformat-PEP8 specification automatic formatting plugin.
    - ConvertToUTF8-Convert local encoding to UTF-8.

> **Note** : In fact, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) may be a better choice. It does not cost money and provides more complete and powerful functions. Interested readers can research on their own.

### Exercise

1. Enter the following code in the Python interactive environment and view the results, please try to translate the content you see into Chinese.

    ```Python
    import this
    ```

    > **说明**：输入上面的代码，在Python的交互式环境中可以看到Tim Peter撰写的[“Python之禅”](../Python%E4%B9%8B%E7%A6%85.md)，里面讲述的道理不仅仅适用于Python，也适用于其他编程语言。

2. Learn to use turtle to draw graphics on the screen.

    > **Description** : Turtle is a very interesting module built into Python. It is especially suitable for small partners who have a first experience in computer programming. It was originally part of the Logo language, which was a programming language invented by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966.

    ```Python
    import turtle

    turtle.pensize(4)
    turtle.pencolor('red')

    turtle.forward(100)
    turtle.right(90)
    turtle.forward(100)
    turtle.right(90)
    turtle.forward(100)
    turtle.right(90)
    turtle.forward(100)

    turtle.mainloop()
    ```

    > **Tip** : The codes provided in this chapter also include the codes for drawing the national flag and the piggy page. Interested readers please study by yourself.
